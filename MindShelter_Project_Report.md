### Design & Components

## Bug Handling & Error Prevention
- **Beer API Image Handling**: Default image is displayed for beers without an image URL.
- **To-Do Task Validation**: Prevents adding tasks without a name.

## Reflection
- The To-Do app was built using tutorial series with personal adjustments, such as error handling and UI improvements.
- Faced challenges with launching the app initially and resolved by using `npm init â€“save` and modifying `package-lock.json`.
- Encountered issues with API CORS but solved them by switching to a compatible API.
